Login Page:
Provide options for users to choose between "Student" or "Staff" login.
Upon selecting "Student," redirect them directly to the view section of the home page.
For "Staff" login, prompt users to enter their username and password for authentication.
Ensure proper validation for the staff login credentials before granting access.
